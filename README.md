# my_ledger Ver. 1.0    

## Introduction
This is a basic ledger written with Python 3 that helps you with personal financial management. You may add your financial records to a new ledger or an existing ledger conveniently with just a few steps.   

To run the program, type and run "python3 basic_ledger.py" in a terminal. A graphic user interface is currently under construction.
