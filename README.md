# my_ledger Ver. 1.1    

## Introduction
(this is a **personal project** for practicing object-oriented programming and defensive programming, and for author's
practical needs to keep personal financial records)

This is a basic ledger written with Python 3 that **helps you with personal financial management**. You may add your financial records to a new ledger or an existing ledger conveniently with just a few steps.   

**Note:** To run the program, type and run "python3 basic_ledger.py" in a terminal. A graphic user interface is currently under construction.   

## Development log
2019/07/23 (Ver. 1.0): basic expense-adding functionality completed; now users may choose to:
1. record expenses in a new ledger (a new .csv file)
2. record expenses in an existing ledger (an existing .csv file)

2019/07/25 (Ver. 1.1):
1. basic defensive programming completed; now simple typing errors would not cause the whole program to crash
2. users may choose to view the specific contents of a ledger, by typing '2' in the main branch

## Future work
**Functionalities incoming:** data analysis & visualization, GUI, encrypted ledgers, redirection when viewing ledgers
